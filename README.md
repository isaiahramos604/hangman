# Overview


I have made this in order to learn a language that i used for memory and opertaing systems. I feel this will give me a better understanding of languages like this


I made a program that will give you 6 guesses and make a handman each time you guess wrong. It uses user input and gives the information needed in order to know how many letters the word as as well as attempts left.

I made this program in order to get a better understanding of how recording user input works on rust.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
